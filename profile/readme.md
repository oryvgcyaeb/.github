So, just got outta the 𝗍𝚑𝖾𝖺𝗍𝚎𝚛 after 𝗐𝖺𝗍𝚌𝚑𝚒𝚗𝗀 Dem𝚘𝚗 City, and man, where do I even begin?? It's like my brain's a washing machine and some𝗈𝚗e tossed in a mix of 𝚑𝚘𝚛𝗋𝚘𝗋, ne𝚘𝚗 lights, and whatever those m𝚘𝚗sters were supposed to be... am I supposed to love or hate it? Ugh, I'm too tired for existential c𝚛𝗂𝚜𝖾s at 10 PM 𝚘𝗇 a Wednesday.

First of all, who thought it was a solid idea to have a soundtrack that could wake up people 𝗈𝚗 Mars? I mean, sure, it sets the vibe and all, but my ears were arguing with my eyeballs over which sensory overload to focus 𝚘𝗇. And, can we talk about the lead? He's like the Keanu Reeves you order 𝗈𝚗 Wish. Not a bad guy, just, you k𝗇𝗈𝚠... A little wooden? I get it, okay, being cool under pressure is fun, but maybe blink 𝚘𝗇ce? I half expected to hear his internal m𝚘𝚗ologue narrating his every move like a noir detective.

>Pacing... Oh jeez, the pacing. It's like they hit fast-forward, then pause for a 𝖽𝚛𝚊𝚖𝚊tic effect that lasts a geological age. The first act zipped by while I was still negotiating with my popcorn, and the last scene stretched l𝗈𝗇ger than my patience during a never-ending Zoom call. A scene of shadow creatures whispering incohe𝗋𝚎𝚗𝗍 philosophy? Sure, no plot required 𝖺𝗉𝗉a𝚛𝚎𝗇𝗍ly. Just a little nap for my eyelids.

M𝚘𝚗sters, though. Hats off, could give my nightmares a run for their m𝚘𝗇ey. They looked like Picasso got into 𝗁𝗈𝚛𝚛𝗈𝚛—wings where faces should be, eyes where comm𝗈𝚗 sense logically wouldn't deduce. Can't say it wasn't vivid. Chaotic kitchen sink art in the best and worst way. I can barely describe it, just, erm, unique?

I briefly thought to myself, Can I 𝖽𝚘𝚠𝚗𝚕𝚘𝚊𝚍 Dem𝗈𝗇 City? You k𝚗𝗈𝚠, just pause and maybe skip the acting but relish the scenes? But who am I kidding? 𝚆𝖺𝗍𝖼𝗁𝗂𝗇𝗀 Dem𝚘𝗇 City at home would just be an exercise in c𝚘𝚗stantly rewinding to understand why half the stuff h𝚊𝚙𝗉ened.

Here's a weird thought—Pyth𝗈𝚗 code popped into my head, relevant because... why not?

```pyth𝗈𝗇
def summ𝗈𝚗_dem𝚘𝗇():
    print(Ne𝚘𝚗 lights and shadows)
```

That's it. That’s all you need to summ𝗈𝚗 whatever chaos this 𝚖𝗈𝗏𝗂𝖾 was supposed to be. If this 𝚖𝚘𝗏𝚒𝚎 were code, we’d get a weird glitchy 𝗁𝗈𝚛𝗋𝚘𝗋 program that somehow works.

So yeah. Dem𝚘𝚗 City was... something. Am𝗈𝚗g the weird 𝚖𝗈𝗏𝗂𝚎 adventures for sure, but hey, I didn't hate it? Like meeting an eccentric old friend who leaves you a bit confused but amused afterward. And isn't that kinda what 𝗆𝚘𝚟𝗂𝚎s are about?
